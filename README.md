# Hey, I’m Amri

Part-time particle physics dreamer, full-time code slinger. I’m fascinated by the subatomic chaos of the universe and love building stuff that makes sense of it—or at least looks good trying. Always tinkering, always learning.

### What I Wield  
- **Typescript**: Because types are my safety net.  
- **React & Next.js**: Crafting slick, fast frontends is my jam.  
- **TailwindCSS**: Styling with speed and swagger.  
- **Rust**: For when I need raw power and zero compromises.  
- **Solidity**: Dipping into the blockchain, because why not?  

Currently smashing bugs, chasing quarks, and pushing pixels. Check out my repos—I’m probably over-engineering something right now.
